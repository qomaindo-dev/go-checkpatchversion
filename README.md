# go-checkpatchversion
To validate the application version.

Where do we know for the application to have a version arrangement like the following:

4.1.2 => <major> "." <minor> "." <patches>

So here I am trying to make a simple example to validate the application version using Golang.

Good Luck and Hope it helps you.
